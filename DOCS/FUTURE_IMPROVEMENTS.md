# Smart Assignment System: Future Improvements & Scaling

## Performance & Scalability

- **Optimize Scripts:** Refactor code to minimize loops and redundant queries.
- **Scheduled Job Throttling:** For large workloads, process records in batches using `GlideRecord.setLimit()`.
- **Monitor Performance:** Use ServiceNow Performance Analytics and Transaction Logs to track system health.
- **Indexing:** Index fields like `assignment_group` and `assigned_to` for faster queries.
- **Queue Management:** For heavy processing, leverage ServiceNow Event Queue or Asynchronous Business Rules.

## Audit & Compliance

- **Logging Schema:** Standardize logs with `[SmartAssignment]` prefix and include ticket ID, assignment group, assigned user, timestamp, and action type.
    - **Script Example:**  
      Use this snippet in your assignment logic to ensure consistent, auditable logs:
      ```javascript
      // Smart Assignment Logging Example
      var logMsg = "[SmartAssignment] Ticket: " + current.sys_id +
                   " | Group: " + current.assignment_group.getDisplayValue() +
                   " | Assigned to: " + (current.assigned_to ? current.assigned_to.getDisplayValue() : "None") +
                   " | Action: Assigned" +
                   " | Timestamp: " + new GlideDateTime().getDisplayValue();
      gs.log(logMsg, "SmartAssignment");
      current.work_notes = (current.work_notes || "") + "\n" + logMsg;
      ```
      This ensures all assignment actions are logged in both system logs and work notes for easy auditing and compliance checks.
- **Dashboard:** Build a ServiceNow dashboard to visualize assignment actions, SLA compliance, and audit trails.
- **Reporting:** Create scheduled reports for assignment actions and SLA breaches.

## Governance

- **Versioning:** Document all changes and improvements in a changelog.
- **Update Set Management:** Use Update Sets for all changes to ensure traceability and easy rollback.
